# Museum Database Web Application

This project is a museum operations database application for COSC 3380. It includes a populated MySQL database and a web application for managing museum records, member services, staff operations, inventory, sales, events, tours, and reports.

The application is organized around different museum roles. Each role sees a dashboard with the actions and reports that apply to that type of user.

## Project Contents

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sqlFiles/` | Database schema, user table setup, seeded login accounts, triggers, stored procedures, views, and membership status logic. |
| `insert_sql_files/` | Sample data used to populate the database. |
| `setup_full_database(RUN THIS ).bat` | Windows script for rebuilding the complete database. |
| `setup_full_database.sh` | macOS/Linux/Git Bash script for rebuilding the complete database. |
| `webapp/` | Web application source code. |
| `webapp/.env.example` | Example database configuration file. |

## Requirements

- MySQL 8.0 or compatible MySQL server
- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm

## Database Setup

The setup scripts drop the existing `museumdb` database, rebuild the schema, load the sample data, create triggers and reports, and insert the test login accounts.

On Windows:

```bat
setup_full_database(RUN THIS ).bat
```

On macOS, Linux, or Git Bash:

```bash
chmod +x setup_full_database.sh
./setup_full_database.sh
```

The scripts will ask for the MySQL host, port, username, password, and database name. The expected database name for the web app is:

```text
museumdb
```

If the Windows script cannot find MySQL, update the `MYSQL` path inside `setup_full_database(RUN THIS ).bat` to match the local MySQL installation.

## Web Application Setup

From the project root:

```bash
cd webapp
npm install
```

Create the environment file:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `webapp/.env` with the MySQL connection values:

```env
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=museumdb
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DB_SSL=false
SESSION_SECRET=replace_me
```

Start the web app:

```bash
npm start
```

Open the application at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Test Login Accounts

The following accounts are inserted by `sqlFiles/004_seed_auth_users.sql`.

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Member/User | `member@example.com` | `member123` |
| Supervisor | `supervisor@example.com` | `supervisor123` |
| Curator | `curator@example.com` | `curator123` |
| Employee | `employee@example.com` | `employee123` |
| Admissions Clerk | `clerk@example.com` | `clerk123` |
| Gift Shop Staff | `giftshop@example.com` | `giftshop123` |
| Cafe Staff | `cafe@example.com` | `cafe123` |
| Marketing/Supervisor | `marketing@example.com` | `marketing123` |

## Data Managed By The Application

The database application supports adding, editing, deleting, searching, and reporting on the following museum data:

- Departments and employees
- Artists and artwork
- Exhibitions and exhibition artwork assignments
- Artwork condition reports and restoration tracking
- Institutions and artwork loans
- Member accounts and membership status
- Tickets and ticket line items
- Events and event registrations
- Tours and tour registrations
- Employee schedules
- Gift shop inventory, sales, and sale line items
- Cafe inventory, orders, and sale line items

## User Roles

| Role | Main Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| `user` | Member/customer access for memberships, ticket purchases, event registration, tour registration, and public collection browsing. |
| `supervisor` | Management access for most database records, reports, notifications, trigger violation review, staff scheduling, and operational oversight. |
| `curator` | Collection access for artists, artwork, exhibitions, exhibition artwork assignments, loans, and condition reports. |
| `employee` | General staff access for operational tasks such as ticketing, sales, registrations, and collection queries. |
| `admissions` | Admissions access for memberships, ticket selling, ticket reports, and membership reports. |
| `giftshop` | Gift shop access for inventory, sales, sale line items, and gift shop reports. |
| `cafe` | Cafe access for food inventory, cafe orders, sale line items, and cafe reports. |

## Trigger Constraints

The database uses triggers in `sqlFiles/008_triggers.sql` to enforce important business rules and semantic constraints.

Examples include:

- Blocking duplicate artists and duplicate artwork records.
- Blocking invalid date or time ranges for exhibitions, events, tours, schedules, and loans.
- Blocking event or tour registration when capacity is full.
- Blocking overlapping employee shifts.
- Blocking ticket sales for expired or cancelled memberships.
- Blocking artwork deletion when the artwork is assigned to an exhibition.
- Blocking exhibition assignment when artwork is currently on an active outgoing loan.
- Blocking gift shop or cafe sales when there is not enough stock.
- Preventing negative gift shop and cafe inventory.
- Updating gift shop and cafe stock automatically after sale line inserts, updates, and deletes.
- Marking poor or critical artwork condition reports as requiring restoration.
- Setting membership expiration dates automatically.
- Creating manager notifications for full events, low stock, out-of-stock items, and salary warnings.

When a trigger raises a MySQL error, the web application records the issue in `trigger_violation_log` so supervisors can review it.

## Queries

The application includes several searchable query pages:

- Collection search by title, artist, style, type, or time period
- Artwork current location and condition tracking
- Exhibition date search
- Gift shop inventory search
- Cafe inventory search
- Exhibition staffing lookup

## Reports

The application includes role-based reports with filters and summary totals:

- Consolidated daily revenue across admissions, gift shop, and cafe
- Ticket sales report
- Employees by department
- Revenue by exhibition
- Gift shop revenue by item
- Cafe revenue by item
- Membership status report
- Member activity report
- Event attendance report
- Tour attendance report
- Employee schedule report

The SQL file `sqlFiles/009_reports.sql` also defines stored procedures and the `Consolidated_Revenue` view used by reporting features.

## Implementation Notes

- The web application runs from `webapp/server.js`.
- Database access uses the `mysql2` package.
- Static assets are stored in `webapp/public/`.
- Uploaded images are stored in `webapp/public/uploads/`.
